        <br /> I'm from Spain and I'm a self-taught programmer.
        <br /> I've been working on customer facing roles since I was old enough
        to work. During the lockdown caused by the pandemic, when I had time off
        to think, the idea of studying something grew up in me. I took a Udemy
        course about web programming. By the time I finished it, I researched
        about more courses and found Freecodecamp. Since the beginning of 2021,
        I was working and studying at the same time. With Freecodecamp, unlike
        Udemy, you don't follow a tutorial and just copy it. You learn the
        theory, apply it in the challenges and at the end, you build projects.
        This is how I learned to code.
        <br />
        <br />
        Apart from the material I've learned from Freecodecamp, I've also
        learned technologies like TailwindCSS and Firebase on my own.
        <br />
        <br />
        Aside from coding, I'm also learning how to draw digitally using
        Photoshop. It's something I like and find relaxing.
